###Pd GUI Objects

This is my working collection of GUI objects based on some Pd and/or other software.
They are made using the HTML5 Canvas.
I cannot attest to their optimization.

I am also not an artist.  

These are designed to be used with my cordova-pd plugin.
```
var dial = new Dial(canvas, ctx, scale, rName, circleColor, dialColor, font, lineWidth);
var button = new Button(canvas, ctx, scale, rName, lineColor, pressColor, font, lineWidth);
```
